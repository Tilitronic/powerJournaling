    `**Practicing Poverty** â€” Seneca's resilience training

The Stoics deliberately practiced small discomforts. Not to punish themselves, but to build mental strength and appreciation.

**The Problem** â€” modern life is TOO comfortable. We become weak, dependent on luxuries, and terrified of any discomfort. When hardship comes, we collapse.

**The Stoic Solution** â€” regularly choose small, voluntary discomforts. This trains your mind that discomfort is survivableâ€”even beneficial.

**What this practice does:**
1. **Builds resilience** â€” when real hardship comes, you're prepared
2. **Breaks hedonic adaptation** â€” you stop taking comfort for granted
3. **Strengthens willpower** â€” you prove you can control urges  
4. **Increases appreciation** â€” comfort feels AMAZING after voluntary discomfort
5. **Reduces fear** â€” you learn: "Discomfort won't kill me. I'm stronger than I thought."

**The Science** â€” your brain predicts suffering based on past experience. If you've never been uncomfortable, small discomforts feel catastrophic. If you practice discomfort, your brain learns: "This is manageable."

**How to practice:**
Choose ONE small discomfort today. Not as punishment â€” as TRAINING.
- Physical: cold shower, skip a meal, exercise when tired
- Social: have the difficult conversation, say no to someone
- Habitual: skip coffee, no phone for 2 hours, sit in silence

**Key** â€” the discomfort should be VOLUNTARY and MILD. You're training, not torturing.
