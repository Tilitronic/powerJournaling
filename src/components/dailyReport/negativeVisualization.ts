    `**Praemeditatio Malorum** â€” Ancient Stoic gratitude practice

This is NOT pessimism. This is **appreciation training** that the Stoics practiced daily.

**The Problem** â€” we take everything for granted. Your health, your home, your loved ones â€” you stop seeing them. Hedonic adaptation makes you numb to your blessings.

**The Solution** â€” briefly imagine losing what you value. When you mentally "lose" something, you suddenly SEE it again with fresh eyes.

**What this practice does:**
- **Breaks hedonic adaptation** â€” stop taking good things for granted
- **Generates genuine gratitude** â€” feel appreciation, not just think it  
- **Prepares you mentally** â€” if loss happens, the shock is less severe
- **Increases present joy** â€” savor what you have RIGHT NOW

**How to practice:**
1. Close your eyes for 10-20 seconds
2. Vividly imagine ONE thing you value being gone (person, health, home, ability)
3. Feel the loss â€” let it be uncomfortable for a moment
4. Open your eyes and appreciate that you STILL HAVE IT

This isn't dwelling on loss. It's a quick mental exercise to restore wonder.
