**Memento Mori** (from Stoicism) â€” "Remember you will die." This isn't morbidâ€”it's the ultimate focusing tool. When you remember death, trivialities fade and what truly matters becomes crystal clear.

**The Four Pillars of Life:**
1. **Happiness & Peace of Mind** â€” inner tranquility and joy
2. **Body & Health** â€” physical wellbeing and vitality  
3. **People & Relationships** â€” love, connection, community
4. **Meaningful Work** â€” contributing something valuable

_"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."_ â€” Marcus Aurelius

**Implementation Intentions** (from Atomic Habits) â€” being specific doubles success rates:
"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."

**The Process:**
1. Remember death â†’ What pillar needs attention?
2. Choose ONE priority that serves that pillar
3. Make a specific plan with when/where
4. Prepare for obstacles`,
